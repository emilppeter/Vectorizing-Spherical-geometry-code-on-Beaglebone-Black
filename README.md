# Vectorizing-Spherical-geometry-code-on-Beaglebone-Black

A program to calculate closest weather station,from a list of given weather stations,to each of the state capitals,using ARM Cortex A8 based Beaglebone black wireless board,is optimized for speed by implementing vectorization on computations involved using NEON SIMD instructions.Outputs obtained after optimization were validated against those obtained using single precision cosine functions.
